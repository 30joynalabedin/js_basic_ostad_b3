/*
In JavaScript, typeof is an operator that is used to determine the data type of a value or variable. It takes a single argument and returns a string indicating the data type of that argument.

For example, if you have a variable x that has the value of 5, you can use typeof x to determine that x is a number. Similarly, if you have a variable y that has the value of "Hello", you can use typeof y to determine that y is a string.

Here are the possible return values of typeof:

"undefined" if the value is undefined
"boolean" if the value is a boolean
"number" if the value is a number
"string" if the value is a string
"bigint" if the value is a BigInt
"symbol" if the value is a symbol
"object" if the value is an object (excluding null)
"function" if the value is a function
It's important to note that typeof null returns "object", which is a historical quirk in JavaScript that cannot be changed without breaking existing code.
